# StockIndicator
A quick python program to try and predict basics stock exchange indicators and the price of said stock at day+X.<br>
<br>
This program is very flawed, it was made for educationnal purposes and is not well coded. My goal is to have a practical tool that i can use for myself.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT : <br>
This program, as of june 11th 2024, gives values for the price of a stock, but this value is highly inaccurate. At this time, the program is more efficient in recognizing tendencies.
<br>
I will be updating this program to :<br>
- Fine-tune the price prediction model (which is now not tuned)
- Use different models to better fit EACH indicators
- Add financial indicators
